# Smart Infrastructure Monitoring

This project implements a smart infrastructure health monitoring system using predictive analytics for bridge maintenance. It includes machine learning models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost) trained on sensor data to predict maintenance needs.

## Project Structure

- **data/:** Contains the sensor data (sensor_data.csv) and maintenance records (maintenance_records.csv).
- **models/:** Stores the trained machine learning models in joblib format.
- **src/:** Python package containing the source code.
  - **__init__.py:** Marks the directory as a Python package.
  - **data_collection.py:** Loads data from CSV files.
  - **exploratory_data_analysis.py:** Performs exploratory data analysis.
  - **feature_engineering.py:** Implements feature engineering on sensor data.
  - **modeling.py:** Trains machine learning models and evaluates their performance.
  - **predictive_analytics.py:** Applies predictive analytics to make maintenance predictions.
  - **aws_deployment/:** Contains scripts for deploying the model on AWS Lambda.
    - **lambda_function.py:** AWS Lambda function for serving predictions.
  - **flask_deployment/:** Implements a simple Flask web interface for user interaction.
    - **app.py:** Flask application for serving predictions through a web interface.
    - **templates/:** HTML templates for the web interface.
      - **index.html:** Main form for user input and displaying predictions.
- **.gitignore:** Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
- **README.md:** Project documentation providing an overview, structure, and usage instructions.
- **requirements.txt:** Lists Python dependencies for the project.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart_infrastructure_monitoring.git

Install dependencies:
bash


pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Flask application locally:
bash

cd src/flask_deployment
python app.py
Visit http://localhost:5000 in your web browser to interact with the model.
Deploying on AWS Lambda
Create an AWS Lambda function using the code in src/aws_deployment/lambda_function.py.
Set up an API Gateway to trigger the Lambda function.
Test the API endpoint with input data to receive predictions.
